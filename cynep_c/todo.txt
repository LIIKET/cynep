TODO:

- Faster file read!
- Eliminate all inner looping in lexer. Think state machine.
- Build constants array in lexer. We could then scrap BufferString struct and rely on NULL termination.
- Eliminate ALL branching in runtime! Replace with more opcodes.
- Remove ALL useless bytes from bytecode format. Only code addresses should need to be 64 bit for instance.
